            <p>Japanese anime and manga have deep cultural roots, both evolving into global phenomena over the years.

<span class="txt-violet"><b>Manga</b></span> as we know it today began in the late 1940s, influenced heavily by Osamu Tezuka's work, particularly Astro Boy. It became a major form of entertainment in Japan, spanning genres for all age groups.

<span class="txt-violet"><b>Anime</b></span> started in the early 20th century, with the first known Japanese animated film in 1917. Tezuka's Astro Boy also helped shape modern anime, making its debut in 1963 as Japanâ€™s first major TV anime. By the 1980s and 90s, anime series like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon gained international popularity.

Today, both anime and manga continue to captivate global audiences, with series like Naruto and My Hero Academia keeping the tradition alive and growing.</p>
